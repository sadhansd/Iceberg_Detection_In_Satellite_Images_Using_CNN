# Iceberg-Detection-in-Satellite-images

Accurate and timely iceberg detection is crucial for maritime safety and economic activities in polar regions. This Project focuses on developing a robust iceberg detection system utilizing satellite imagery. A CNN-based model is employed to classify remote sensing targets as icebergs or ships, addressing the common challenge of misclassification. To enhance the system's practical application, a Pygame-based simulation environment is created for visualizing detected icebergs. Furthermore, an A* algorithm is integrated to determine the shortest safe path between two points, avoiding identified icebergs and ships.
