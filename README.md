# Iceberg-Detection-in-Satellite-images

Iceberg detection is more critical in previous research. High-quality satellite monitoring of dangerous ice formations is critical to navigation safety and economic activity in the regions. Satellite images play a crucial role in the identification of icebergs. It is based on the satellite dataset for target classification and target identification. The iceberg detection is based on the statistical criteria for finding the satellite images. This CNN-based model is used to identify automatically whether is remote sensed target is an iceberg or not. Sometimes the iceberg is wrongly classified as a ship. This model is done to make accurate changes in the detection. The pygame is used to simulate the results
